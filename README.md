# The Scenario
UWUaaS (UWU as a Service) is an up and coming startup that provides an API to serve cute images to its users via a REST API. The startup is looking to you to ship some awesome new features! While we have a frontend working to serve cute images from a database, the startup is looking to add some exciting new features. Today, as the newest backend engineer at UWUaaS, you are going to be adding a new microservice, as well as fix a few outstanding bugs from our customers! 

## The Outline
